            <h4>Board</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The board is made up of cavities and containers. There is a container per player and a variable amount of cavities. Both players must have the same amount of cavities in each side.</li>
                <li>The pieces are seeds. Each player control the seeds that are stored in their side's cavities.</li>
                <li>In the beggining of the game, the storage is empty and the cavities are equally filled with seeds.</li>
                <li></li>
                <li>If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip it and continue moving to the next pocket.</li>

            <h4>Gameplay</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A player chooses one of the cavities on his side and picks up all of the seeds. The player then puts all the seeds in his hand in the next cavities, one seed in each, done in counter clock wise.</li>
